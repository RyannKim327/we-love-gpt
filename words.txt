There is a curse, that follows the good
The more you give, the more they take
The more you love, the more they betray
You stand in silence, holding your pain
Because you think that's what strength is
But deep down, you wonder why me
Why always me
You sacrifice yourself, for people who don't even care for you
You forgive those who cut you the deepest
And in return, the world rewards you with scars
But hear me now your kindness is not weakness
The world doesn't break the weak, it breaks the strong
It fears those who can endure
So let them hurt you
Let them doubt you
Every scar you carry, is proof that you chose to rise
To stay kind when the world begged you to be cruel
Your pain is proof of your power
Stay good, even when it hurts.
